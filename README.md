# algonquin-pronounciation
This program determines the pronunciation of an Algonquin word

Most Indigenous languages in Canada are considered endangered, and indigenous peoples are fighting for the survival of their language and culture. Indigenous languages are an integral part of Indigenous identity and Canada’s cultural identity. An essential component of Indigenous decolonization and empowerment is the protection and enhancement of their heritage language. Moreover, research reveals that “children not only learn better in their own heritage language as opposed to one of the societally dominant languages, but also develop a more positive and healthier view of themselves.”

There are nine Indigenous languages still used in Quebec: Montagnais, Naskapi, Inuktitut, Cree, Algonquin, Atikamekw, Mohawk, Abenaki, and Mi’kmaq. This program allows us to retrieve the pronunciation of an Algonquin word.
